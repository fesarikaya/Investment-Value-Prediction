# Investment Value Prediction

This project focuses on predicting investment values using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and trained on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) data.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict investment values based on historical FDI data. The project uses a dataset from FAOSTAT containing information about foreign direct investments across different countries and sectors.

## Files in the Repository

1. `InvestmentValuePrediction_TF.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
2. `investment_predictions.csv`: CSV file containing the predicted investment values.
3. `InvestmentValuePrediction.pdf`: Detailed project report explaining the methodology, results, and conclusions.
4. `Foreign direct investment - FAOSTAT_data_en_2-27-2024.csv`: Raw data file from FAOSTAT used for training and testing the model.
